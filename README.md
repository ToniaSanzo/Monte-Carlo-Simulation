# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Monte Carlo Simulation, Determine the probablity of succesfully reaching Town A from Town B. Given that the 5 roads connecting the Towns all have a probablity of failing. Compares the confidence interval of a non-parametric method with a sample size of 20x times larger than the parametric method, to compare the accuracy of different confidence interval techniques
